<h1>Homework 1: Web Development</h1>
<p>My name is Leandra Suriel. I’m 21 years old and currently a 24cr studio art major, pursuing a BA in it. I’m a calm person who values peace, quiet, and time with Jesus. I love creating and expressing myself through different forms of art. My main focus is drawing and painting, but I also sculpt, work digitally, and I’m beginning to learn crochet. I was born in the Dominican Republic and lived there until I was 11, before moving to the United States right before turning 12. Since then, I’ve been living in Brooklyn, balancing college life with other work responsibilities outside of class.</p>
<p> My goal is to build a career centered around art, since it’s something I truly love and find joy in. Studying art is not just about earning a degree for me—it’s about growing into the artist I hope to become. Every project I work on, whether it’s painting, sculpting, or trying new creative skills, strengthens my passion and reminds me why I chose this path. Art brings me happiness, and I intend to dedicate my future to it.</p>
