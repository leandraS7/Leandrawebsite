<p>The two images I chose are: a flower seen through a “dark tunnel” made from a Bounty paper roll, and my pet turtle, Layla (her name for now, depending on gender). I picked these because both struck me as beautiful and caught my attention. I knew I could enhance them using light, hue, or saturation.
For the flower, I cropped it along the rule of thirds so the circle with the petals is centered and more in focus. I brightened the inside of the circle, lowered the whites a bit, and increased the contrast. I also used the curves adjustment layer, moving the four color points (gray, red, green, blue) and adding new ones until I achieved the look I wanted. The result gives the petals the effect of being lit by moonlight, almost like a soft night lamp.</p>
<p> For my second image of Layla, I shifted her slightly to the right of the grid’s center. I adjusted the light, whites, brightness, and contrast, just like I did with the flower. Then I experimented more with the curves, adding extra points and adjusting the colors until a rainbow-like glow formed around her shell and the surrounding space. Finally, I applied a vibrance adjustment layer, setting vibrance to 100% and saturation to 30%. I wanted to try something new. Making the image feel more alive, almost dreamlike. Overall, I’m happy with how both edits turned out.</p>
