<h1>Homework 3: Depth of Field</h1>

<i><p>I decided to use the cones photo since it was one of the decent ones I took for this assignment, and they isnt anything interesting to capture on school.  First I resized the image to 7x5(w x h), I centered the image where I liked and then started the blur process. First I selected the lasso tool and started selecting the part of depth I wanted blurred to create the effect we were assigned to do,  then I duplicated the selection and tap on where the Gaussian blur is in the photoshop app on my iPad. I decided to set the blur on 5.7 after I was done testing it around, I think that is how the effect would look with a camera. Then I exported the image to Jepg on my device.</p>
  <p> as well i took some pictures at home of the depth of field, all done by the camare and the size stayed the same. i put the objects in the center and aligment i wanted which are the moon lamp and the oil, and then played around with the depth on f3.2 or 4 to 5, till i got the results i wanted.

<i><p>I particularly liked this image although  the smell of the garbage was gross but it came out somewhat nicely and vintage like the old noise tvs. For this photo I as well resize it to 7 x 5 since I like the small looking size of the photo, and centered the photo where I liked. After I tap it on the 3 dots, selected after effects and then exposure. I lower it the exposure to - 2.36, still getting the like of dark garbage look but without the noise dots, then I just exported the image.</p>
<p>Same for this image, resized the image to 7 x 5, center it and when to the tree dots, after effects and then exposure, I lower it the exposure to - 2. 68, since selecting a specific part didnt work as I wanted and that wasnt the assignment. I used the exposure for the whole image as directed, then I exported the image and finished my assignment. </p></i>
