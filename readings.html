<h3>Reading Response #001: <i>In Plato's Cave</i></h3>
<p> For me, capturing an image or making an image is the art of freezing a moment in time, or of reflecting and portraying an emotion, a feeling, or an impact depending on the situation. It is also a way of remembering something to hold on to, to pass down through generations, and to use in many different ways. As Susan Sontag describes in “On Photography”, photographs can be used by everyone, and their role has shifted from being seen purely as art to becoming something like amusement, a cultural habit as common as dancing. With photographs, we can resize them, cut them, glue them together, and create something entirely new. They can generate a reaction to public issues, serve as part of a personal gallery, or simply preserve important memories like a graduation or birthday. A camera is also a tool of evidence, proof that a certain moment really happened.
Designing or editing a photo is important to me because it makes me more aware of the choices I make: tones, hues, light, vibrance, sharpness. Each decision affects the feeling the picture gives and what I want to communicate through it. Photography has the power to direct attention to one focus point, to highlight what others might not notice. It can reveal sadness in a shadowed window or joy in the way sunlight glitters across a green landscape. For me, it is less about just capturing reality and more about translating it, so that others can see through my eyes, through the lens, what I felt in that moment.</p>

<p> Adding graphics or text to an image can enhance the emotion I want to portray. Text can deepen meaning, exaggerate a message, or help comment on the world rather than only document it. Photography is not just about images anymore, it has become a cultural statement. It is something people use daily to share their world, their interests, or their emotions. Fashion in magazines for example; use images and design to spark desire or aspiration. In a similar way, I can use the same tools for different purposes, either to build a fantasy world with imagination and symbols, or to reflect the reality of our current world.
Although I have not yet experimented much with text directly on my images, I imagine how I might use it. I could bend words around a figure, play with values and hues, and mask the text into the photo so it feels almost like a body within the image itself. Through this combination of photography and text, I could represent aspects of our world right now, perhaps showing the rhythm of daily commutes, the balance between connection and disconnection, or the way technology shapes our lives. By exaggerating certain objects in relation to people, I could symbolize the pressure and dominance these forces have in today’s society.
Ultimately, photography and image-making are how I question and interpret reality. They allow me to document what I see, but also to reshape it, to emphasize the details, moods, and truths that matter most to me, and to share my perspective of the world in this moment.</p>
