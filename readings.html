<h3>Reading Response #001: <i>In Plato's Cave</i></h3>
<p> For me, capturing an image or making an image is the art of freezing a moment in time, or of reflecting and portraying an emotion, a feeling, or an impact depending on the situation. It is also a way of remembering something to hold on to, to pass down through generations, and to use in many different ways. As Susan Sontag describes in “On Photography”, photographs can be used by everyone, and their role has shifted from being seen purely as art to becoming something like amusement, a cultural habit as common as dancing. With photographs, we can resize them, cut them, glue them together, and create something entirely new. They can generate a reaction to public issues, serve as part of a personal gallery, or simply preserve important memories like a graduation or birthday. A camera is also a tool of evidence, proof that a certain moment really happened.
Designing or editing a photo is important to me because it makes me more aware of the choices I make: tones, hues, light, vibrance, sharpness. Each decision affects the feeling the picture gives and what I want to communicate through it. Photography has the power to direct attention to one focus point, to highlight what others might not notice. It can reveal sadness in a shadowed window or joy in the way sunlight glitters across a green landscape. For me, it is less about just capturing reality and more about translating it, so that others can see through my eyes, through the lens, what I felt in that moment.</p>

<p> Adding graphics or text to an image can enhance the emotion I want to portray. Text can deepen meaning, exaggerate a message, or help comment on the world rather than only document it. Photography is not just about images anymore, it has become a cultural statement. It is something people use daily to share their world, their interests, or their emotions. Fashion in magazines for example; use images and design to spark desire or aspiration. In a similar way, I can use the same tools for different purposes, either to build a fantasy world with imagination and symbols, or to reflect the reality of our current world.
Although I have not yet experimented much with text directly on my images, I imagine how I might use it. I could bend words around a figure, play with values and hues, and mask the text into the photo so it feels almost like a body within the image itself. Through this combination of photography and text, I could represent aspects of our world right now, perhaps showing the rhythm of daily commutes, the balance between connection and disconnection, or the way technology shapes our lives. By exaggerating certain objects in relation to people, I could symbolize the pressure and dominance these forces have in today’s society.
Ultimately, photography and image-making are how I question and interpret reality. They allow me to document what I see, but also to reshape it, to emphasize the details, moods, and truths that matter most to me, and to share my perspective of the world in this moment.</p>

<h3>Reading Respose #002: <i>AI slope</i></h3>
<p> AI slop its interesting and terrifying. Interesting because it helps create and connect with others and terrifying because what you connect with or interact in belief with, it desensitizes you from the reality and what matters in that reality. Consuming that type of “AI slop” as the article interprets, it’s meant to distract you and keep you interacting with it for the sake of likes and engaging. Personally with this i don't really relate much as i have realize a while that i needed for my own health, critical thinking and human discerning, to step back from all this social media interactions and waste less scrolling. In short I haven’t interacted much with things mentioned on the article specially from “X”, i really don’t use that app. However i have seen some AI slop in Instagram and TikTok and its as disturbing as the article mentions, more on the part of the interaction of the people in the comment sections and when they are shared to other group chats, the discernment of belief of this things has diminished that some cannot recognize wether is fake or real as long as its connect with their internal belifs no matter how immoral it may be. Sure they are some funny and adorable ones like the talking baby like an adult or the cute animals like pup seal. However it doesn’t minimize the potential danger of this tool and the political implications it gives, which Malik does imply through the article, highlighting it with urgency as AI is its own crew, no armies, no cameras, no witnesses, it makes propaganda more available to the public. It holds the power of the narrative. For instance Ai generated videos or photos for the election seasons, people trusting the information on what they saw believing it to be true and then expressing it to others who considered them a reliable source  with no idea to how differentiated the real from the fake for the elderly at least although even my generation gets scammed and believe this dumb agendas. This type of sources which hold the power as Malik says. There’s multiple issue the AI slope can produce , for one baseless heated arguments in families or group chats believing the source of the fabricated material. Which gives back to Malik’s point to who holds the power in that situation, letting misinformation slips past even to the most skeptical minds. Personally I haven’t seen much or nothing at all on what Malik said of the algorithm of nostalgia based contents, trad wife or aesthetics. But it does makes sense since AI works around existing info and that its still desirable for some or it might be an idea planted by the higher ups, who knows at this point. What i do know though its that this article made me even more aware of my media consumption, making me want to quit it more and focus more in other areas for improving my braking and getting the resources myself not trusting a one biased algorithm, in short it’s honestly terrifying. </p>
